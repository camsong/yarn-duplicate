# Yarn Duplicate

A small tool to help you check package duplicates in `yarn.lock`.

### Usage
1. Change to your project root folder, which have a `yarn.lock` file.
2. ` npx yarn-duplicate`

if you don't have `npx` installed, use: 

```sh
npm install -g yarn-duplicate
yarn-duplicate
```

### Caveats
Only support Yarn V1.x right now.
